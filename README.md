# EU_NATO_1961_2021

The data dashboard [EU Nato Theatre: 1961-2021](https://rpubs.com/Thom_JH/EU_NATO_1961_2021) explores the European NATO theatre in terms of Life Expectancy and Per Capita GDP (PPP) for the years 1961 to 2021, with two additional focused studies of eight key nations from 1949, NATO's founding, to 2021. 

After examining all the evidence, I conclude as follows: the data shows Russia has been in steep decline. Hence we need to update our thinking, world-view, and policies accordingly. Understanding that Russia is in decline provides much needed context both for dealing with with Putin’s desperate invasion of Ukraine, and for assessing Russia’s future threat potential.

This repository contains the data and base scripts used to construct that dashboard. It does not contain all the files, but would allow one if interested to fully reproduce my results. The plot below is static; the dashboard version, dynamic.
